        1) Encapsulation:
        ->Encapsulation is the process of wrapping variables (data) and methods together inside a class.
        ->It enables data hiding, ensuring that sensitive information is not directly accessible from outside the class.
        ->We are restricting the direct access to the variables using access modifiers like private, public, and protected, we control how data is accessed or modified.
        ->To modify these private variables safely, we use getter and setter methods.
        ->The number of getter and setter methods depends on how many variables we want to protect.

        -> Real-time example:
        The wallet is the class.
        Your cash and cards are the private data.
        
        2) Inheritance:

        3) Abstraction:

        4) Polymorphism:
